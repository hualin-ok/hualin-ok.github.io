> Welcome to **Hua Lin**'s webpage. I am a developmental and family scientist and quantitative research methodologist, serving as a post-doctoral fellow in the [Cennter for Immingrant Health and Eduation](https://education.okstate.edu/research/centers/center-immigrant-health-education/) at Oklahoma State University. 

## Research Interests

<a href="/home/"><img style="float: right; width: 540px; margin: 0px 5px 5px" src="images/Family3-1.jpg"></a>

> One of my research interests is the development of [**parent-child interactions**](/research/#the-development-of-parent-child-interactions), in that I focus on momentary parenting goals, parental competency, and social withdrawal. I was certified by Active Parenting in 2015 for teaching “Active parenting 4th edition” and “Parenting Your 1- to 4-Year-Old.”
>
> My research interest in [**immigrant family well-being**](/research/#resilience-in-immigrant-families) focuses on how immigrant-related stress impacts adolescent health and behavior and how a psycho-educational intervention can buffer against stress and/or ameliorate the effects of stress in immigrant families from a resilience perspective.
>
> My research interest in [**quantitative methods**](/research/#making-causal-inference-in-longitudinal-analyses) is enhancing causal evidence from non-randomized longitudinal research designs, cross-cultural psychometric appropriations (including Item Response Theory), and statistic model comparison (mediation moderation, propensity score matching, SEM models, MLM models, Latent class analysis, dual-centered ANCOVA, etc.). 
>
> I am also applying [**statistical software**](/research/#data-visualization) such as Stata, Mplus, R, SAS, and Python in research and teaching. I have been certified by Data Carpentry to teach data management and statistic programs in Data Carpentry Workshops (e.g., Introduction to R) and Software [Workshops](/workshops) (e.g., Python) at OSU.
