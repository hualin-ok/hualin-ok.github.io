## Data/Software Workshops @ OSU

> I am interested in applying statistical software such as Stata, Mplus, R, SAS, and Python in research and teaching. I am a certificated instructor by [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/) and am teaching workshops for graduate students and faculty to use open-source software tools and computing resources such as R, Python, OpenRefine, and Git at [OSU Carpentry Organization](https://osu-carpentry.github.io/).
